I am an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Florida. I am excited about *anything robotics*, but it is a vast field, so my focus has been mostly on **motion planning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **active perception**. I have pursued research under the [Active Perception and Robot Intelligence Lab](https://janeshin-website.github.io/) under the guidance of Dr. [Jane Shin](https://janeshin-website.github.io/people/jane/), as well as the [Smart Autonomy Lab](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/smart-autonomy-lab/) under Dr. [Yu Wang](https://sites.google.com/view/y-wang), and I am always trying to learn more. Check out the other tabs to learn more about me, and feel free to reach out via email if you want to talk about anything!

Aside from reading papers or running simulations, I also do other fun stuff like going to the gym, playing soccer, playing mobile games, and watching Netflix (my favorite show is Dark, go check it out!).

And lastly, this is my favorite robot-related image:
