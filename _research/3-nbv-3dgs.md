Project Description
======
Underwater tasks such as structures inspection, hydrographic surveys, and aquatic species monitoring present important problems that are unsafe for humans to do, requiring the deployment of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) to reconstruct underwater scenes and objects. In this project, I aim to develop an efficient algorithm for an underwater robot to navigate around and capture images of the object of interest. These captured images will then be processed using learning-based 3D view synthesis algorithms such as 3D Gaussian Splatting or Neural Radiance Field. However, the images cannot be captured arbitrarily, as the robot has limited power, so the view path needs optimize for both information and movement constraints.
